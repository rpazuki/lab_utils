    #
    # iupac_name: Some compounds have different IUPAC names than their common names.
    #    for instance 'Azanium' is the IUPAC name for 'Ammonia' (NH4+).
    # The mass_per_litre (in g/L unit) is used as the default concentration (0.0 means use model default)
    #
    # source default value is unstated. supplement has the highest precedence and usually reads
    # from metadata. medium is the next in precedence, and usually is in stock form and probably
    # is in compound form. fixed means fixed flux that does not change.
    #
    # If is_compound is true, the compound is made up of multiple parts, so, using pubchempy and its
    # SMILES structure, we can compute the molecular weight of the entire subcompoundd.
